🐍 Practice Python

This is my first step toward building a strong foundation in IT.

👋 Hi, I'm Kamlesh Vanchhode

🚀 I'm starting my journey in the IT and programming world by learning Python — from basics to advanced concepts.
After spending some time preparing for government exams, I realized my passion lies in technology and coding.
Now, I'm focused on improving my programming skills step by step to build a successful career in tech.

📘 What I'm Learning

Python Basics: Syntax, variables, data types, loops, and conditions

Intermediate Concepts: Functions, lists, tuples, and dictionaries

Advanced Topics (Coming Soon): File handling, libraries, and mini-projects

Tools: GitHub for version control and project sharing

🎯 Goals

To build a strong base in Python, create small projects,
and gradually move toward advanced programming and real-world applications.
